  - What is VEX?


## What is VEX?
[VEX Robotics](https://www.vexrobotics.com) is a company that produces robotics kits similar to [*LEGOÂ® Mindstorms*](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/mindstorms). They are made to be used in competitions across the globe. There are 2 versions: *VEX IQ* and *VEX EDR*. We primarily use EDR, as this is the variant made for older students. There are, of course, other variants than just IQ or EDR, such as *VEXPro*.
